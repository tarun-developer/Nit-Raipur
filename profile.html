Most business start-ups begin with one main financial objective – to survive.

Why survival? Because a large percentage of new businesses do not survive much beyond their launch. The entrepreneur discovers that the business idea is not viable – the business cannot be run profitably or it runs out of cash. Start-ups have a high failure rate.

Survival is about the business living within its means. To survive, the business needs to have enough cash to pay the debts of the business as they arise – suppliers, wages, rent, raw materials and so on. To survive, a business needs to have:

Sufficient sources of finance (e.g. cash, a bank overdraft, share capital)
A viable business model – i.e. one which can make a profit

<p>I spent some time at Rise Conference here in Hong Kong this week. The conference hosts a few hundred startups from all across Asia and offers each of them a booth, an opportunity to pitch, and the hope of meeting their next, investor, engineer, or growth hacker.

It was complete startup sensory overload. The talks are only 20 minutes long and as soon as you sit down at one, you are missing two others. The conference floor looks like a real incubator (in the biological sense) with rows of embryonic business plans. The only difference is that instead of dozens of dull eggs, each startup’s logo, swag, and even costumes begs for your attention.</p>
